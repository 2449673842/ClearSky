# ClearSky[![TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/ClearSkyTeam/ClearSky.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ClearSkyTeam/ClearSky)
ClearSky is an ultra fast Minecraft: Pocket Edition server software with clean feels and stable features. It was initially designed for production servers.
 - We may take code from other GPL licenced projects, but most features are fully-rewritten for ClearSky.

## Where can I get a phar?
 - **Before you launch ClearSky please remove pocketmine.yml once to update.**
 - You can get a tested phar here: [ClearSkyTeam/ClearSky-Release](https://github.com/ClearSkyTeam/ClearSky-Release).

##[CRITICAL]: Please REMOVE xdebug in production server
 - You can comment out zend_extension=php_xdebug in your php.ini or recompile PHP without xdebug.
 - There is also a switch under debug in pocketmine.yml to force enable xdebug.

## Advanced Settings
You can find many useful new settings in pocketmine.yml.<br>
For example : Redstone, Weather, Experience, Hunger switch
